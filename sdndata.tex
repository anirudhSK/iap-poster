\frametitle{Why is no single data plane configuration the best?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bufferbloat on variable-rate links helps throughput!

      \item Variable-rate links have an inherent delay-throughput tradeoff
      \end{itemize} 

\item[] 

\item FCFS is preferable to Fair Queuing in some cases
      \begin{itemize}
      \item When equally aggressive flows compete, they don't need
        protection from each other
        \item Helps reduce tail packet delay

\frametitle{So what should the network designer do?}
Architect a flexible data plane
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement in-network queue management and scheduling in a
  programmable way
\item Not just for selecting among pre-built choices, but to change
  behavior in the field
\item Because there is no silver bullet and innovation will continue!

\frametitle{Controlled flexibility: Want performance, security,
  reliability}

(Or, why this isn't the same as ``active networks'')

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide interfaces to the head and tail of queues
\item Operators specify only queue-management/scheduling logic
\item Code size limits constrain program sophistication
\item No access to packet payloads (for now)

\item Hardware gadgets (primitives)

      \item Random number generators (RED, BLUE)
      \item Binary tree of comparators (pFabric, SRPT)
      \item EWMA estimators (RED, AVQ, CSFQ)
      \end{itemize}

\item I/O interfaces
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Drop/mark head/tail of queue
      \item Interrupts for enqueue/dequeue
      \item Read packet headers
      \end{itemize}

\item State maintenance
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Per-flow (WFQ, DRR)
      \item Per-src address (PF)
      \item For fastest flows alone (AFD)
      \end{itemize}

\item A domain-specific instruction set
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Expresses control flow
      \item Implements new functions unavailable in hardware

%%%%%%%%\begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%\item Cannot express several important network functions:
%%%%%%%%      \begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%      \item ``Deep-packet'' Inspection
%%%%%%%%      \item Intrusion Detection
%%%%%%%%      \item Spam Filtering
%%%%%%%%      \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%\item Mechanism for signaling application objectives to the network.
%%%%%%%%      \begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%      \item Could use DiffServ codepoints.
%%%%%%%%      \item But ASes generally don't honor codepoints from other ASes.
%%%%%%%%      \item May be a non-issue inside a Data Center.
%%%%%%%%      \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%\item Most switches today have a shared pipeline with demanding requirements.
%%%%%%%%      \begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%      \item Top-of-the-line switches have 64 ports, each running at 10G.
%%%%%%%%      \item Implies that queueing/scheduling logic should run at 64*10G.
%%%%%%%%      \item If queue management is enqueue-based, e.g., RED, this problem cannot be fixed by replicating digital logic on each port.
%%%%%%%%      \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%\item Mechanism to map flows onto per-port queues is required for scheduling.
%%%%%%%%      \begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%      \item Also need to decide on the number of such queues.
%%%%%%%%      \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%\item Interoperability
%%%%%%%%      \begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%      \item Across switch vendors.
%%%%%%%%      \item Across FPGA vendors.
%%%%%%%%      \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%\item Energy and Area overheads.
