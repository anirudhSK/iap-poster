\section*{Problem setting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cellular networks are variable.
\begin{centering}
{\small

}
\end{centering}
\item Cellular networks are too reliable.
\item Consequently, interactive apps perform poorly because they are reactive
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprout's goal}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximize throughput at receiver.
\item Subject to a bounded risk (at most 5\%) of delay exceeding 100 ms.
\end{itemize}

\section*{How it works}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\textbf Inference:} Infer probability distribution of link speeds from packet arrivals.
\item {\textbf Prediction:} Predict future link speed.
\item {\textbf Control:} Send as much as possible, but ensuring a 95 \% probability that all packets are delivered within 100 ms.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Inference}
\begin{itemize}
\item Model arrival process at the receiver as a Poisson process with a time-varying rate $\lambda$.
\item Use number of packet arrivals in a 20 ms tick, to infer a distribution of link rates.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Prediction}
At the receiver:
\begin{itemize}
\item Model evolution of link rates as a random walk with constant volatility.
\item Explicitly model outages, by biasing the random walk to remain in an outage.
\item Cautious forecast: Derive the 5th percentile of cumulative number of packet deliveries.
\item Send back forecast to sender.
\item Almost all steps are precalculated.
\item TODO: Throw in Sprout's Model
\end{itemize}

\section*{Control}
At the sender:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fill up 100 ms forecast window.
\item TODO: Put in figure of forecasting.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Saturate a cellular link in both the uplink and downlink directions.
\item Use saturated trace to drive a trace driven link emulator.
\item We also evaluate Sprout-EWMA, a simplified variant, that uses an EWMA filter to track link rates and simply feeds it back to the sender. It doesn't predict link rates or infer a link rate distribution.
\end{itemize}
